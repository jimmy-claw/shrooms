# A blind relay (docs/blind-relays.md).
#
# Nothing like the node image above it, and that is the point: a relay links no
# native library, holds no mesh identity, and keeps no state, so it builds from
# source in one stage and ships on scratch. A few megabytes, no volume, no
# capabilities, running as nobody.
#
# That is what makes it deployable on ephemeral compute — Akash, a free tier, a
# spare container somewhere — where a persistent volume is the usual obstacle
# and there is nothing here to persist. A redeployed relay costs one refresh
# interval of downtime, because the forwarding table is soft state that its
# clients rebuild without being asked.
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM pins the build stage to the machine doing the
# building, and GOARCH below picks the target. Without it, buildx runs this
# stage under QEMU for every architecture — minutes become tens of minutes, and
# for no reason: a Go compiler cross-compiles natively, and there is no cgo here
# to need a cross toolchain.
#
# This is the one image in the project that can be built for any architecture on
# any machine. The node image cannot, because liblogosdelivery has to be built
# or fetched per architecture and building it from source has been broken
# upstream since September. None of that applies here.
